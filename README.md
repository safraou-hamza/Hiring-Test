# Hiring-Test

## I tried to be creative by adding some animations ✨

### used lottie for animations, angular material for the table and locomotiveJS for the scroll functionalities.

## Development server

#### Start by `npm install` to install my applications dependencies. Then fire the `ng serve --open`.

#### Please try reloading the page until the api server rejects our http request to see the error page and try refetching the data by clicking on the retry button to see the fail animation of the button. And search for an non-existent employee to see the not found animation.

## I hope you will like my work 🤲🏻😄
